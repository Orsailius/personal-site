            `,options:F},{staticText:`You center yourself and commune with the Spirit of Christmas. 
            You tell it that Santa has abandoned the true meaning of Christmas, by being selfish.
            Santa is giving the gift of carbon emmissions, all so he can bath in the sun. 
            Your argument works and the Spirit of Christmas abandons Santa

            "No! I am Santa, lord of the North Pole, and none shall defeat me!"

            Massive chunks of ice burst through the floor and float middair. Shearing winds spiral around the room knocking Santa's
            hat to the floor

            "You think what I do is easy?! Huh? You wouldn't last a day in my shoes!"

            You command the ice at Santa it relentlessly bombards him. You cast a cone of frost at Santa
            sealing the ice chunks around him. 

            Santa is now encased in ice, magically frozen for eternity!

            You walk over and pick up Santa's cap. You sit back in Santa's rocking chair, glancing at the room you have both destroyed.
            The hat sparkles in your hands and you proclaim
            "There must always be a Santa"
            You lift the hat and place it on your head feeling the power coursing within it. Through the magic of Christmas the room cleans itself up.

            You have won, and now you sit on the Frozen Throne

                    He follows it shortly with a jolly o kick.

                    "Looks like the world is getting coal this year after all"

                    Santa sits on top of your chest nearly crushing you
